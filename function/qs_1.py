# User defined functions

# Functions→
# Functions are the block of code written in a file and given a specific name. Whenever we need that block of code we can simply call the specific name given to it,automatically the code written inside the block will be executed

# We dont need to write that code again and again,we can just call the function name to execute the code whenever required

# Types of functions
# Predefined functions→ functions already defined by the developers
# E.g input(),print(),append(),len()
# User defined functions →when programmers prepare functions for their own sake of use and call whenever required is call UDF

# def add():
#     a=int(input("Enter the Number = "))
#     b=int(input("enter the 2nd Number = "))
#     c=a+b
#     print("the addtion is = ",c)
# add()
